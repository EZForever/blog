My tiny & shabby blog site.

## Messages to visitors
Hello & welcome to read these messy notes.

If you want to comment on a post, please [open an issue](https://github.com/ezforever/ezforever.github.io/issues). I'll find a better way to deal with discussion threads later but by now this is the only one working.

## Why?
I know GitHub Pages supports Jekyll, which I admit is awesome, but I decide to keep my attitude to Ruby (and Python).

Hard to say why I hate them. Maybe [this post](https://www.hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php?/archives/825-8-Reasons-Python-Sucks.html) gets the point.

Another approach to build a blog is to find a web-hosting platform. However those platforms suck when I'm lack of financial support and visit the blog from China.

The last reason is to block search engines crawling my posts. That little hashtag in URL does it well.

## How?
Markdown contents are downloaded, parsed and rendered all by your browser, thanks to AJAX technology. Therefore, no annoying blank page will appear when on a poor network.

Using fragments (the hashtag) in URL does a huge impact on SEO. I consider it as a feature rather than a drawback.

Many thanks to the [TeXMe](https://github.com/susam/texme) project, which gives me the initial inspiration, a page template and a Markdown+LaTeX parser.
